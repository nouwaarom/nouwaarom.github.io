  <meta name="description" content="This is a little introduction to who I am. I have always been intrigued by technology. When I was in elementary school I was trying to understand how planes and engines worked and then tried to design them myself in paint :). In highschool I became interested in computers because I started gaming. I wanted to write a game myself so I tried to build something in Unity3D. In university I studied electrical engineering and embedded systems and learned a lot more about hardware and software design. I am currently working as an embedded software engineer, which is a lot of fun.">
