This is a little introduction to who I am.
I have always been intrigued by technology. When I was in elementary school I was trying to understand how planes and engines worked and then tried to design them myself in paint :).

In highschool I became interested in computers because I started gaming.
I wanted to write a game myself so I tried to build something in Unity3D.
In university I studied electrical engineering and embedded systems and learned a lot more about hardware and software design.
I am currently working as an embedded software engineer, which is a lot of fun.
