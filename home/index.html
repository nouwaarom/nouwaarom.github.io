      <a href="/qt/2021/12/19/qt-addressbook-example.html">Qt TableView: Improved Addressbook Example - 19 Dec 2021</a>
      <p>In this post I want to discuss the Qt6 <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtwidgets-itemviews-addressbook-example.html">addressbook example</a>, which is used to explain model/view in Qt.
I will show how we can modify this example to a more maintainable architecture by decoupling the widget and the model.
The original example can be found in Qt creator.
The modified code can be found at my <a href="https://www.github.com/nouwaarom/Qt-Addressbook-Example">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <p>This is part two of a series, part one can be found <a href="/embedded/c/initialize_monitor_handles/2021/01/30/investigating-semihosting.html">here</a>.
In this post we will investigate how we can print using semihosting.
In the previous post we noticed that <em>puts</em> was used to print a string to stdout.</p>

      <p>When developing software for ARM microcontrollers there is a big chance that you want to use semihosting.
Using semihosting you can send debug messages over SWD of JTAG using the debugger.
This makes development easier as you do not need an other peripheral.
I found that setting up semihosting myself was quite confusing.
If you browse the internet there are some posts and guides on how to setup semihosting, but almost none really explaning what is going on internally.
In this post I will dig deeper in to how it works.</p>

      <a href="/misc/2019/12/05/model-checking.html">Model Checking - 05 Dec 2019</a>
      <p>This post is a simple introduction modelchecking.
The goal of model checking is to verify if the behaviour of a system is as intended.
This verification is especially usefull for safety-critical systems.
Here are some examples:
For the software in a car you want the brake pedal to <em>always</em> make the car brake, you do not want the turning on the radio can effect this behaviour.
For the traffic lights of an intersection you <em>never</em> want two crossing lanes to have green light at the same time.
A second intended behaviour of a traffic light system is that every lane will get green <em>eventually</em>.</p>

      <a href="/misc/2019/11/22/welcome.html">Introduction - 22 Nov 2019</a>
      <p>This is a little introduction to who I am.
I have always been intrigued by technology. When I was in elementary school I was trying to understand how planes and engines worked and then tried to design them myself in paint :).</p>

<p>In highschool I became interested in computers because I started gaming.
I wanted to write a game myself so I tried to build something in Unity3D.
In university I studied electrical engineering and embedded systems and learned a lot more about hardware and software design.
I am currently working as an embedded software engineer, which is a lot of fun.</p>
